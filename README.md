# Global-Sales-Dashboard-Project-Looker-Studio-
This project presents an interactive Sales Dashboard built in Google Looker Studio, designed to visualize and analyze global sales data across product categories, regions, and time periods. As a data analyst, I explored the dataset, cleaned it, and created a dashboard that reveals key trends in profit, cost, and sales performance.
This dashboard demonstrates my ability to work with real-world data, build compelling visualizations, and communicate actionable insights to support strategic decision-making.

# Dataset
The dataset (Sales.xlsx) contains international sales transactions across 34 countries and includes the following fields:

Product Category and Subcategory

Sales Amount

Profit

Cost of Sales

Unit Cost

Order Quantity

Country & Region

Date of Sale

After cleaning and preparing the data, it was connected to Looker Studio for visualization and interaction.

# Dashboard Features
Built using Looker Studio, the dashboard includes:

Total Sales: $55.4M

Average Profit per Transaction: $2.1K

Total Cost of Sales: $23.8M

Number of Countries: 34

Order Quantity: 15,000+

Top Product Categories by Sales:

Computers: $21.3M

Cameras & Camcorders: $17.0M

# Visualizations
 Profit by Category – Line chart over time to highlight profitability trends in product categories

 Profit by Region – Time-based line chart by continent to analyze geographical trends

 Top 5 Subcategories by Profit – Percentage-based bar chart

 Unit Cost by Country – Aggregated cost analysis by location

The dashboard includes filters and drill-down features to allow dynamic data exploration.

# Key Insights
 Computers lead in global sales at over $21M, significantly ahead of other categories.

 North America and Asia consistently generate higher profits compared to other regions.

 Top 5 Subcategories account for nearly 48% of total profit, showing strong concentration.

 Some regions and categories show negative or low profitability, indicating areas for cost optimization or product review.

 Unit Cost concentration varies widely by country, highlighting opportunities for localized pricing or supply chain adjustments.

# Recommendations
Double down on high-performing categories like Computers and Cameras by expanding inventory or marketing in high-profit regions.

Investigate low or negative profit trends in certain regions or time periods to reduce loss drivers.

Leverage subcategory profitability insights to refine pricing strategies and product placement.

Use cost-by-country data to improve supply chain efficiency or renegotiate vendor contracts in high-cost regions.
