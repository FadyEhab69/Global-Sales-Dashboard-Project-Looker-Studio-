# Global-Sales-Dashboard-Project-Looker-Studio-
This project presents an interactive Sales Dashboard built in Google Looker Studio, designed to visualize and analyze global sales data across product categories, regions, and time periods. As a data analyst, I explored the dataset, cleaned it, and created a dashboard that reveals key trends in profit, cost, and sales performance.
